# Validating the waveforms' accuracy

It is of great interest to have a check regarding the 
accuracy of the waveforms generated by `mlgw_bns`. 

The class {class}`ValidateModel <mlgw_bns.model_validation.ValidateModel>` is provided for this purpose. 

The simplest usage of this class, assuming we already have a `model`,
is to compute a set of mismatches between the waveforms generated 
by this model and its reference EOB generator. 

The syntax is as follows: 
```python
from mlgw_bns import ValidateModel

vm = ValidateModel(model)

mismatches = vm.validation_mismatches(100)
```

This will compute 100 mismatches, generating the corresponding 
parameters randomly. 
For more advanced usage, see {class}`ValidateModel <mlgw_bns.model_validation.ValidateModel>`.
