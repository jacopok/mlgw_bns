The particular study of this article is within the context of the gravitational waves emitted by the collision of two spinless black holes in initial quasi-circular orbit. We find, for example, that approaches such as Gaussian process regression with radial bases as kernels do provide a sufficiently accurate solution, an approach which is generalizable to multiple dimensions with low computational evaluation cost. The results here presented suggest that AutoML might provide a framework for regression in the field of surrogates for gravitational waveforms. Our study is within the context of surrogates of numerical relativity simulations based on Reduced Basis and the Empirical Interpolation Method, where we find that for the particular case analyzed AutoML can produce surrogates which are essentially indistinguishable from the NR simulations themselves.},

  abstract = {Deep learning methods have been employed in gravitational-wave astronomy to accelerate the construction of surrogate waveforms for the inspiral of spin-aligned black hole binaries, among other applications. We demonstrate, that the residual error of an artificial neural network that models the coefficients of the surrogate waveform expansion (especially those of the phase of the waveform) has sufficient structure to be learnable by a second network. Adding this second network, we were able to reduce the maximum mismatch for waveforms in a validation set by more than an order of magnitude. We also explored several other ideas for improving the accuracy of the surrogate model, such as the exploitation of similarities between waveforms, the augmentation of the training set, the dissection of the input space, using dedicated networks per output coefficient and output augmentation. In several cases, small improvements can be observed, but the most significant improvement still comes from the addition of a second network that models the residual error. Since the residual error for more general surrogate waveform models (when e.g. eccentricity is included) may also have a specific structure, one can expect our method to be applicable to cases where the gain in accuracy could lead to significant gains in computational time.},

We present the first frequency-domain model for inspiral, merger and ringdown of the GW signal from precessing binary-black-hole systems that also includes multipoles beyond the leading-order quadrupole. Our model, \{\textbackslash tt PhenomPv3HM\}, is a combination of the higher-multipole non-precessing model \{\textbackslash tt PhenomHM\} and the spin-precessing model \{\textbackslash tt PhenomPv3\} that includes two-spin precession via a dynamical rotation of the GW multipoles. We validate the new model by comparing to a large set of precessing numerical-relativity simulations and find excellent agreement across the majority of the parameter space they cover. For mass ratios \${$<$}5\$ the mismatch improves, on average, from \$\textbackslash sim6\textbackslash\%\$ to \$\textbackslash sim 2\textbackslash\%\$ compared to \{\textbackslash tt PhenomPv3\} when we include higher multipoles in the model. However, we find mismatches \$\textbackslash sim8\textbackslash\%\$ for the mass-ratio \$6\$ and highly spinning simulation. As a first application of the new model we have analysed the binary black hole event GW170729. We find larger values for the primary black hole mass of \$58.25\^\{+11.73\}\_\{-12.53\} \textbackslash, M\_\textbackslash odot\$ (90\textbackslash\% credible interval). The lower limit (\$\textbackslash sim 46 \textbackslash, M\_\textbackslash odot\$) is comparable to the proposed maximum black hole mass predicted by different stellar evolution models due to the pulsation pair-instability supernova (PPISN) mechanism. If we assume that the primary \textbackslash ac\{BH\} in GW170729 formed through a PPISN then out of the four PPISN models we considered only the model of Woosley (2017) is consistent with our mass measurements at the 90\textbackslash\% level.},

The model relies on the idea of incorporating general Newtonian prefactors, instead of the usual quasi-circular ones, in both radiation reaction and waveform. The major advance with respect to previous work is that the quasi-circular limit of the model is now correctly informed by numerical relativity (NR) quasi-circular simulation. This provides EOB/NR unfaithfulness for the dominant quadrupolar waveform, calculated with Advanced LIGO noise, at most of the order of \$1\textbackslash\%\$ over a meaningful portion of the quasi-circular NR simulations calculated by the Simulating eXtreme Spacetime (SXS) collaboration. In the presence of eccentricity, the model is similarly NR-faithful, \$\textbackslash lesssim 1\textbackslash\%\$, all over the 28 public SXS NR datasets, with initial eccentricity up to \$\textbackslash simeq 0.2\$ , mass ratio up to \$q=3\$ and dimensionless spin magnitudes as large as \$+0.7\$. Higher multipoles, up to \$\textbackslash ell=5\$ are also reliably modeled through the eccentric inspiral, plunge merger and ringdown.

Surrogate modelling yields fast and accurate approximations of gravitational waves and neural networks have been used in the final step of interpolating the coefficients of the surrogate model for arbitrary waveforms outside the training sample. We investigate the existence of underlying structures in the empirical interpolation coefficients using autoencoders. We demonstrate that when the coefficient space is compressed to only two dimensions, a spiral structure appears, wherein the spiral angle is linearly related to the mass ratio. Based on this finding, we design a spiral module with learnable parameters, that is used as the first layer in a neural network, which learns to map the input space to the coefficients. The spiral module is evaluated on multiple neural network architectures and consistently achieves better speed-accuracy trade-off than baseline models. A thorough experimental study is conducted and the final result is a surrogate model which can evaluate millions of input parameters in a single forward pass in under 1ms on a desktop GPU, while the mismatch between the corresponding generated waveforms and the ground-truth waveforms is better than the compared baseline methods. We anticipate the existence of analogous underlying structures and corresponding computational gains also in the case of spinning black hole binaries.},

  abstract = {As gravitational-wave detectors become more sensitive, we will access a greater variety of signals emitted by compact binary systems, shedding light on their astrophysical origin and environment. A key physical effect that can distinguish among formation scenarios is the misalignment of the spins with the orbital angular momentum, causing the spins and the binary's orbital plane to precess. To accurately model such systems, it is crucial to include multipoles beyond the dominant quadrupole. Here, we develop the first multipolar precessing waveform model in the effective-one-body (EOB) formalism for the inspiral, merger and ringdown (IMR) of binary black holes: SEOBNRv4PHM. In the nonprecessing limit, the model reduces to SEOBNRv4HM, which was calibrated to numerical-relativity (NR) simulations, and waveforms from perturbation theory. We validate SEOBNRv4PHM by comparing it to the public catalog of 1405 precessing NR waveforms of the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) collaboration, and also to new 118 precessing NR waveforms, which span mass ratios 1-4 and spins up to 0.9. We stress that SEOBNRv4PHM is not calibrated to NR simulations in the precessing sector. We compute the unfaithfulness against the 1523 SXS precessing NR waveforms, and find that, for \$94\textbackslash\%\$ (\$57\textbackslash\%\$) of the cases, the maximum value, in the total mass range \$20-200 M\_\textbackslash odot\$, is below \$3\textbackslash\%\$ (\$1\textbackslash\%\$). Those numbers become \$83\textbackslash\%\$ (\$20\textbackslash\%\$) when using the IMR, multipolar, precessing phenomenological model IMRPhenomPv3HM. We investigate the impact of such unfaithfulness values with two parameter-estimation studies on synthetic signals. We also compute the unfaithfulness between those waveform models and identify in which part of the parameter space they differ the most. We validate them also against the multipolar, precessing NR surrogate model NRSur7dq4, and find that the SEOBNRv4PHM model outperforms IMRPhenomPv3HM.},

Fast and accurate theoretical models of the gravitational radiation emitted from these coalescences are highly important for the detection and extraction of physical parameters. Spinning effective-one-body models for binaries with aligned-spins have been shown to be highly faithful, but are slow to generate and thus have not yet been used for parameter estimation (PE) studies. I provide a frequency-domain singular value decomposition-based surrogate reduced order model that is thousands of times faster for typical system masses and has a faithfulness mismatch of better than {$\sim$}0.1\% with the original SEOBNRv1 model for advanced LIGO detectors. This model enables PE studies up to signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of 20 and even up to 50 for total masses below 50 M{$\odot$}. This paper discusses various choices for approximations and interpolation over the parameter space that can be made for reduced order models of spinning compact binaries, provides a detailed discussion of errors arising in the construction and assesses the fidelity of such models.},

  abstract = {We apply machine learning methods to build a time-domain model for gravitational waveforms from binary black hole mergers, called mlgw. The dimensionality of the problem is handled by representing the waveform's amplitude and phase using a principal component analysis. We train mlgw on about \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(10\^3)\$ TEOBResumS and SEOBNRv4 effective-one-body waveforms with mass ratios \$q\textbackslash in[1,20]\$ and aligned dimensionless spins \$s\textbackslash in[-0.80,0.95]\$. The resulting models are faithful to the training sets at the \$\{\textbackslash sim\}10\^\{-3\}\$ level (averaged on the parameter space). The speed up for a single waveform generation is a factor 10 to 50 (depending on the binary mass and initial frequency) for TEOBResumS and approximately an order of magnitude more for SEOBNRv4. Furthermore, mlgw provides a closed form expression for the waveform and its gradient with respect to the orbital parameters; such an information might be useful for future improvements in GW data analysis. As demonstration of the capabilities of mlgw to perform a full parameter estimation, we re-analyze the public data from the first GW transient catalog (GWTC-1). We find broadly consistent results with previous analyses at a fraction of the cost, although the analysis with spin aligned waveforms gives systematic larger values of the effective spins with respect to previous analyses with precessing waveforms. Since the generation time does not depend on the length of the signal, our model is particularly suitable for the analysis of the long signals that are expected to be detected by third-generation detectors. Future applications include the analysis of waveform systematics and model selection in parameter estimation.},

  abstract = {Gravitational waves from the coalescences of black hole and neutron stars afford us the unique opportunity to determine the sources' properties, such as their masses and spins, with unprecedented accuracy. To do so, however, theoretical models of the emitted signal that are i) extremely accurate and ii) computationally highly efficient are necessary. The inclusion of more detailed physics such as higher-order multipoles and relativistic spin-induced orbital precession increases the complexity and hence also computational cost of waveform models, which presents a severe bottleneck to the parameter inference problem. A popular method to generate waveforms more efficiently is to build a fast surrogate model of a slower one. In this paper, we show that traditional surrogate modelling methods combined with artificial neural networks can be used to build a computationally highly efficient while still accurate emulation of multipolar time-domain waveform models of precessing binary black holes. We apply this method to the state-of-the-art waveform model SEOBNRv4PHM and find significant computational improvements: On a traditional CPU, the typical generation of a single waveform using our neural network surrogate SEOBNN\_v4PHM\_4dq2 takes 18ms for a binary black hole with a total mass of \$44 M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ when generated from 20Hz. In comparison to SEOBNRv4PHM itself, this amounts to an improvement in computational efficiency by two orders of magnitude. Utilising additional GPU acceleration, we find that this speed-up can be increased further with the generation of batches of waveforms simultaneously. Even without additional GPU acceleration, this dramatic decrease in waveform generation cost can reduce the inference timescale from weeks to hours.},

  abstract = {We present an introduction to some of the state of the art in reduced order and surrogate modeling in gravitational-wave (GW) science. Approaches that we cover include principal component analysis, proper orthogonal (singular value) decompositions, the reduced basis approach, the empirical interpolation method, reduced order quadratures, and compressed likelihood evaluations. We divide the review into three parts: representation/compression of known data, predictive models, and data analysis. The targeted audience is practitioners in GW science, a field in which building predictive models and data analysis tools that are both accurate and fast to evaluate, especially when dealing with large amounts of data and intensive computations, are necessary yet can be challenging. As such, practical presentations and, sometimes, heuristic approaches are here preferred over rigor when the latter is not available. This review aims to be self-contained, within reasonable page limits, with little previous knowledge (at the undergraduate level) requirements in mathematics, scientific computing, and related disciplines. Emphasis is placed on optimality, as well as the curse of dimensionality and approaches that might have the promise of beating it. We also review most of the state of the art of GW surrogates. Some numerical algorithms, conditioning details, scalability, parallelization and other practical points are discussed. The approaches presented are to a large extent non-intrusive (in the sense that no differential equations are invoked) and data-driven and can therefore be applicable to other disciplines. We close with open challenges in high dimension surrogates, which are not unique to GW science.},
