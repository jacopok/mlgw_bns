We present the first frequency-domain model for inspiral, merger and ringdown of the GW signal from precessing binary-black-hole systems that also includes multipoles beyond the leading-order quadrupole. Our model, \{\textbackslash tt PhenomPv3HM\}, is a combination of the higher-multipole non-precessing model \{\textbackslash tt PhenomHM\} and the spin-precessing model \{\textbackslash tt PhenomPv3\} that includes two-spin precession via a dynamical rotation of the GW multipoles. We validate the new model by comparing to a large set of precessing numerical-relativity simulations and find excellent agreement across the majority of the parameter space they cover. For mass ratios \${$<$}5\$ the mismatch improves, on average, from \$\textbackslash sim6\textbackslash\%\$ to \$\textbackslash sim 2\textbackslash\%\$ compared to \{\textbackslash tt PhenomPv3\} when we include higher multipoles in the model. However, we find mismatches \$\textbackslash sim8\textbackslash\%\$ for the mass-ratio \$6\$ and highly spinning simulation. As a first application of the new model we have analysed the binary black hole event GW170729. We find larger values for the primary black hole mass of \$58.25\^\{+11.73\}\_\{-12.53\} \textbackslash, M\_\textbackslash odot\$ (90\textbackslash\% credible interval). The lower limit (\$\textbackslash sim 46 \textbackslash, M\_\textbackslash odot\$) is comparable to the proposed maximum black hole mass predicted by different stellar evolution models due to the pulsation pair-instability supernova (PPISN) mechanism. If we assume that the primary \textbackslash ac\{BH\} in GW170729 formed through a PPISN then out of the four PPISN models we considered only the model of Woosley (2017) is consistent with our mass measurements at the 90\textbackslash\% level.},

  abstract = {Building upon recent work, we present an improved effective-one-body (EOB) model for spin-aligned, coalescing, black hole binaries with generic orbital configurations, i.e. quasi-circular, eccentric or hyperbolic orbits. The model relies on the idea of incorporating general Newtonian prefactors, instead of the usual quasi-circular ones, in both radiation reaction and waveform. The major advance with respect to previous work is that the quasi-circular limit of the model is now correctly informed by numerical relativity (NR) quasi-circular simulation. This provides EOB/NR unfaithfulness for the dominant quadrupolar waveform, calculated with Advanced LIGO noise, at most of the order of \$1\textbackslash\%\$ over a meaningful portion of the quasi-circular NR simulations calculated by the Simulating eXtreme Spacetime (SXS) collaboration. In the presence of eccentricity, the model is similarly NR-faithful, \$\textbackslash lesssim 1\textbackslash\%\$, all over the 28 public SXS NR datasets, with initial eccentricity up to \$\textbackslash simeq 0.2\$ , mass ratio up to \$q=3\$ and dimensionless spin magnitudes as large as \$+0.7\$. Higher multipoles, up to \$\textbackslash ell=5\$ are also reliably modeled through the eccentric inspiral, plunge merger and ringdown. For hyperbolic-like configurations, we also show that the EOB computed scattering angle is in excellent agreement with all currently available NR results.},

  abstract = {As gravitational-wave detectors become more sensitive, we will access a greater variety of signals emitted by compact binary systems, shedding light on their astrophysical origin and environment. A key physical effect that can distinguish among formation scenarios is the misalignment of the spins with the orbital angular momentum, causing the spins and the binary's orbital plane to precess. To accurately model such systems, it is crucial to include multipoles beyond the dominant quadrupole. Here, we develop the first multipolar precessing waveform model in the effective-one-body (EOB) formalism for the inspiral, merger and ringdown (IMR) of binary black holes: SEOBNRv4PHM. In the nonprecessing limit, the model reduces to SEOBNRv4HM, which was calibrated to numerical-relativity (NR) simulations, and waveforms from perturbation theory. We validate SEOBNRv4PHM by comparing it to the public catalog of 1405 precessing NR waveforms of the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) collaboration, and also to new 118 precessing NR waveforms, which span mass ratios 1-4 and spins up to 0.9. We stress that SEOBNRv4PHM is not calibrated to NR simulations in the precessing sector. We compute the unfaithfulness against the 1523 SXS precessing NR waveforms, and find that, for \$94\textbackslash\%\$ (\$57\textbackslash\%\$) of the cases, the maximum value, in the total mass range \$20-200 M\_\textbackslash odot\$, is below \$3\textbackslash\%\$ (\$1\textbackslash\%\$). Those numbers become \$83\textbackslash\%\$ (\$20\textbackslash\%\$) when using the IMR, multipolar, precessing phenomenological model IMRPhenomPv3HM. We investigate the impact of such unfaithfulness values with two parameter-estimation studies on synthetic signals. We also compute the unfaithfulness between those waveform models and identify in which part of the parameter space they differ the most. We validate them also against the multipolar, precessing NR surrogate model NRSur7dq4, and find that the SEOBNRv4PHM model outperforms IMRPhenomPv3HM.},

The run time of standard parameter estimation techniques with these long waveforms can be months or even years, making it impractical with existing Bayesian inference pipelines. Reduced order modeling and reduced order quadrature integration rule have recently been exploited as promising techniques that can greatly reduce parameter estimation computational costs. We describe a Python-based reduced order quadrature building code, PyROQ, which builds the reduced order quadrature data needed to accelerate parameter estimation of gravitational waves. We present the first bases for the IMRPhenomXPHM waveform model of binary-black-hole coalescences, including subdominant harmonic modes and precessing spins effects. Furthermore, the code infrastructure makes it directly applicable to the gravitational wave inference for space-borne detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).},

  abstract = {We apply machine learning methods to build a time-domain model for gravitational waveforms from binary black hole mergers, called mlgw. The dimensionality of the problem is handled by representing the waveform's amplitude and phase using a principal component analysis. We train mlgw on about \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(10\^3)\$ TEOBResumS and SEOBNRv4 effective-one-body waveforms with mass ratios \$q\textbackslash in[1,20]\$ and aligned dimensionless spins \$s\textbackslash in[-0.80,0.95]\$. The resulting models are faithful to the training sets at the \$\{\textbackslash sim\}10\^\{-3\}\$ level (averaged on the parameter space). The speed up for a single waveform generation is a factor 10 to 50 (depending on the binary mass and initial frequency) for TEOBResumS and approximately an order of magnitude more for SEOBNRv4. Furthermore, mlgw provides a closed form expression for the waveform and its gradient with respect to the orbital parameters; such an information might be useful for future improvements in GW data analysis. As demonstration of the capabilities of mlgw to perform a full parameter estimation, we re-analyze the public data from the first GW transient catalog (GWTC-1). We find broadly consistent results with previous analyses at a fraction of the cost, although the analysis with spin aligned waveforms gives systematic larger values of the effective spins with respect to previous analyses with precessing waveforms. Since the generation time does not depend on the length of the signal, our model is particularly suitable for the analysis of the long signals that are expected to be detected by third-generation detectors. Future applications include the analysis of waveform systematics and model selection in parameter estimation.},
