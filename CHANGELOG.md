# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.12.1] - 2022-11-01

### Fixed

- Fixed [#46](https://github.com/jacopok/mlgw_bns/issues/46), an issue with the wrong version of joblib leading to models not being able to be loaded.

## [0.12.0] - 2022-10-15

### Added

- New functionality for [multiple default models](https://github.com/jacopok/mlgw_bns/pull/45)
    - two models available: the `default` one and a `fast` one, trained from 5 and 15Hz respectively.
- `extend_with_post_newtonian` and `extend_with_zeros_at_high_frequency` flags for the `Model` class,
    which determine whether to raise an exception or not when extending the model beyond its
    training frequency range.

### Changed

- The `flatten_phase` method of the `Residuals` dataclass now returns the timeshifts 
    which the waveforms were shifted by, instead of `None`
- Call signature for the `Model.default` classmethod: now, the first available argument 
    is `model_name`, which determines which of the default provided models to use;
    the keyword argument to use to choose the name to give to the current model is `filename`.

### Fixed

- Amplitude connection at low frequency: there is typically a (<1%) discrepancy in the EOB vs. 
    Post-Newtonian amplitude at the low frequency bound. Now, at frequencies lower than the minimum one,
    the amplitude varies continuously, and reaches its PN value at half of the minimum frequency.

## [0.11.0] - 2022-09-19

### Added

- Possibility to extend waveform evaluation to arbitrarily low frequencies, using the 
    post-Newtonian expressions. 
- Mention of this changelog in the README
- Reference documentation about the mathematical details of higher order modes
- Removed dependence on `pycbc` for PSD computations (see [this PR](https://github.com/jacopok/mlgw_bns/pull/38)): 
    this significantly decreases the dependency load of the package
- Also saving metadata with each saved model - this means the model does not rely on the settings
    used being the same as when the model was generated. 
    Metadata is saved as a human-readable yaml file.
- New convenience classmethod, `ParametersWithExtrinsic.gw170817()`, to get some quick parameters

### Removed

- Python 3.7 support

### Changed

- Standard model is now trained with `sklearn` version 1.1.2.

## [0.10.2] - 2022-07-01

### Fixed

- Improve evaluation speed, by reducing downsampled array size (set tolerance to 1e-5)
    - now the speeds, going down to 5Hz, are the same as those we had for 20Hz
- Improve test execution speed (in `tests/test_model.py`)

### Added

- Test profiling availability

## [0.10.1] - 2022-06-30

### Added

- Changelog!
- Some badges in the README:
    - coverage report with [coveralls](https://coveralls.io/)
    - downloads per month

### Changed

- Default model given now starts from 5Hz

### Fixed

- PCA now uses SVD
- Fix TEOB call error, which occurred when the integration time exceeded 1e9M
- Fix `ValidateModel` frequency arrays
- Various fixes to tests
