## [Unreleased]

## [0.11.0] - 2022-09-19

### Added

- Possibility to extend waveform evaluation to arbitrarily low frequencies, using the 
    post-Newtonian expressions. 
- Mention of this changelog in the README
- Reference documentation about the mathematical details of higher order modes
- Removed dependence on `pycbc` for PSD computations (see [this PR](https://github.com/jacopok/mlgw_bns/pull/38)): 
    this significantly decreases the dependency load of the package
- Also saving metadata with each saved model - this means the model does not rely on the settings
    used being the same as when the model was generated. 
    Metadata is saved as a human-readable yaml file.
- New convenience classmethod, `ParametersWithExtrinsic.gw170817()`, to get some quick parameters

### Removed

- Python 3.7 support

### Changed

- Standard model is now trained with `sklearn` version 1.1.2.

## [0.10.2] - 2022-07-01

### Fixed

- Improve evaluation speed, by reducing downsampled array size (set tolerance to 1e-5)
    - now the speeds, going down to 5Hz, are the same as those we had for 20Hz
- Improve test execution speed (in `tests/test_model.py`)

### Added

- Test profiling availability

## [0.10.1] - 2022-06-30

### Added

- Changelog!
- Some badges in the README:
    - coverage report with [coveralls](https://coveralls.io/)
    - downloads per month

### Changed

- Default model given now starts from 5Hz

### Fixed

- PCA now uses SVD
- Fix TEOB call error, which occurred when the integration time exceeded 1e9M
- Fix `ValidateModel` frequency arrays
- Various fixes to tests
